# Introduction

Control of two pololu motors with their respective encoders

The encoder ticks are read periodically using the Systick timer.

Other timers used in the example
* Timer 2 is used to count the number of ticks of the left encoder
* Timer 1 is used to count the number of ticks of the right encoder
* Timer 4 is used for the PWM of the two motors: CH3 for the left motor and CH4 for the right motor

Encoder measurements are sent periodically through the serial port

## Pinout (FIXME: check and complete)

Motors:
* PC13 -> LED integrated in the bluepill board.
* PB08 and PB09 -> Timer 4 PWM CH3 (left motor) and CH4 (right motor).
* PA12 and PB5 -> Motor driver control pins for left motor.
* PB10 and PB11 -> Motor driver control pins for the right motor
   L        L  -> brake low
   H        L  -> forward
   L        H  -> reverse
   
Encoders:
* PA15 -> Out A (left motor encoder)
* PB3 -> Out B (left motor encoder)
* PA8 -> Out A (right motor encoder)
* PA11 -> Out B (right motor encoder)


Serial Port 
* PA09 and PB10 -> Serial port Tx/Rx.
